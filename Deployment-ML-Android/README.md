Strongly consider manual review and further diagnostics. | | Second Most Likely: Second Most Likely: Glioma (26.94%) | | Clinical Considerations: CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: • No immediate intervention needed. • Recommend routine follow-up if clinically indicated. • Consider alternative diagnoses if symptoms persist. ⚠️ NOTE: Due to lower confidence in prediction, consider: • Additional imaging (contrast-enhanced MRI). • Second opinion from neuroradiologist. • Clinical correlation with patient symptoms.
